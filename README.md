This repository contains the complete data and analysis code used to generate the figures in the pyPhotometry manuscript:

*Akam, Thomas, and Mark E. Walton. "pyPhotometry: Open source Python  based hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition." Scientific reports 9.1 (2019): 3521.*

To use the code, extract the data folder from the zip file data.zip and place the unzipped data folder in the same directory as the *code* folder.  To generate figures import the file 'figures.py' into python and generate figures by calling the functions in the section titled 'Functions for generating figures.'
